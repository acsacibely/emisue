                    One Sister have I in our house -	
                    And one a hedge away.	
                    There's only one recorded,	
                    But both belong to me.

                    One came the way that I came -	        
                    And wore my past year's gown -	
                    The other as a bird her nest,	
                    Builded our hearts among.

                        She did not sing as we did -	
                        It was a different tune	-     
                        Herself to her a Music	
                        As Bumble-bee of June.

                        But up and down the hills	
                        I held her hand the tighter -	        
                        Which shortened all the miles -
